## WOW has this been the **MOST** difficult thing I have ever done so far.

I know that this assignment is *very* late but I think I got the hang of it finally. This week started off with a simple screenshot and ended with some of the hardest things. The hardest part for my was trying to upload it onto Github.

Some of the things I still find confusing are
1. Github
2. How to upload to Github
3. Uploading assignments on moodle or Github
4. Adding images on this assignment

Likewise- a few things I actually have caught onto so far are
- where the back-tick is located
- How to use a markdown cheat sheet for most of things
- How to make a list hopefully
- And of course that I need to come in for some one on one help.

The above link is to not only the greatest search engine on earth, but it was a test to see if I can add one in here. I hope I can mark that off of my Things to learn list.
Trying to make all of these different things work together get confusing after a whole.
