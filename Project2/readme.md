  First off I know that I am BEYOND late for this. I am sorry about that.
I have no excuse and am aware of the grade changes I will be recieving.
  I seem to be confused on the instructions a bit for the first part of this so
I just did my ingredient list since I am doing a recipe as that is what I seem to of gotten in the TO DO section. During this assignment I learned that not a lot has stuck with me so far and I REALLY have to start putting in more effort for this than I really initially thought. I kept getting my code backwards. For Example; when I was making my unordered list instead of doing </li> to end it, I was doing <li/> to end it and it was not coming out right for the longest time.
